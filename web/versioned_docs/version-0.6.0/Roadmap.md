# 🛣️ Roadmap

## 🌍 **Earth Science Plotting (In Progress)** ✏️

Integrates various geological plotting and mapping methods developed by earth scientists worldwide into a unified toolkit. This enables users to select methods tailored to their specific needs and achieve one-click plotting operations. This module not only accelerates the routine generation of figures in scientific research but also promotes the standardization and widespread application of various geological methods and tools, enhancing the overall efficiency of geological research.

## 🌡️ **Geothermometer & Geobarometer Calculations (In Progress)** 📊

Integrates multiple geological geothermometer and geobarometer calculation models to compute physical parameters such as temperature and pressure. The system provides detailed calculation processes and result interpretations, outputting corresponding phase diagrams and P-T (pressure-temperature) diagrams. This assists users in deep-level geological interpretation and analysis, meeting the refined demands of geological research and applications.

## 🤖 **AI Assistant** 💡

Responsible for parsing and offering suggestions on specific content within the vectorized basemap guidelines. It aims to assist users in scenarios where discriminant analysis is unclear by proposing basic data requirements and core datasets. Through intelligent analysis, the assistant recommends optimal analysis schemes based on user-provided data characteristics. The ultimate goal is to simplify operational complexity and significantly improve analysis efficiency and accuracy.

## 📈 **Machine Learning Data Analysis** 🔍

Conducts in-depth analysis of user geochemical data based on machine learning algorithms. Users can customize the selection of machine learning models, and the system supports automated hyperparameter tuning, model training, and evaluation. The final output includes model performance evaluation, variable importance analysis, and relevant visualization charts—such as ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance bar charts—helping users fully comprehend the analysis results.

## ⚗️ **Geochemistry-Related Scientific Calculations** 🧪

Provides a professional scientific calculation toolkit tailored for geochemical data, covering functions such as elemental correlation analysis, isotope ratio calculations, and rare earth element (REE) distribution pattern analysis. The toolkit supports batch data processing, complex formula calculations, and result visualization, helping researchers efficiently complete the processing and interpretation of geochemical data while ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of scientific research results.
