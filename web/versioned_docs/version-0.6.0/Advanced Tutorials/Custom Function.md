# 🔢 Custom Functions

For geothermometer calculations, you can also utilize built-in custom functions for direct computation. The currently built-in geothermometer calculation functions are listed below:

| Function | Parameter Count | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Zircon_Loucks_et_al_2020(ti,p,aTiO2,aSiO2)` | 4 | Zircon Ti temperature calculation, major elements, Loucks et al. (2020) |
| `Zircon_Watson_and_Harrison_1983(SiO2,Al2O3,fe2o3,feo,mgo,p2o5,cao,k2o,na2o)` | 10 | Zircon Zr temperature calculation, major elements, Watson and Harrison (1983) |
| TBD... | | |

> **Note:** Due to considerations regarding intermediate calculation processes and the expansion of thermometer calculation methods, these functions are subject to change with version updates. We recommend consulting the latest documentation before use.
