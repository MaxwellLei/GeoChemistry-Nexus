# 🌍 Tutorial Intro 

Let's get started with **Geo-Thermometer in under 5 minutes** ⏱️.

## Preparation 🛠️

Before you begin, make sure that you have downloaded and installed the .NET 6 SDK on your operating system. Please follow these steps:

1. **Select Download Option** 🌐:
   - You can either [click here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) to visit the .NET 6 download page and choose the appropriate installer based on your specific operating system version.
   - Alternatively, during software installation, follow the prompts to navigate to the website for downloading.
2. **Determine Operating System Type** 💻:
   - For Windows systems, please first determine whether your operating system is `32-bit` or `64-bit`, and select the corresponding SDK version for installation.

:::tip

**Windows Users**: Please ensure that your operating system version is at least Windows 7.

## Getting Started 🚀

[Click here](https://github.com/MaxwellLei/GeoChemistry-Nexus/releases) to access the download page. Choose the appropriate version, download, and extract it. Then, double-click to run `Geo-Thermometer.exe` 🖱️.

### Package Naming Explanation 📦:

The package naming follows this format:  
`SoftwareName_Abrv_Version_Dependency_OperatingSystem_Architecture`

- If the name contains a `d`, it indicates that the software depends on the **.NET 6 SDK** which needs to be installed separately. 🔍
- If `d` is absent, the software already includes the necessary components, and no additional installation is required. ✅

### Note for Linux and Mac Users 🐧🍏:

Currently, due to limited testing time, there are no specific instructions available for Linux and Mac users. Further details will be added in the future. 📅
