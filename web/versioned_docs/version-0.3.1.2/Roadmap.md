# 🛣️ Roadmap

## **🌍 Earth Science Mapping and Visualization (In Progress) ✏️**
Integrating various geological mapping and visualization methods developed by global earth scientists, we have created a unified toolkit that supports users in selecting appropriate methods based on their specific needs and achieving one-click visualization operations. This module not only accelerates the generation process of routine graphics in scientific research but also promotes the standardization and broader application of various geological methods and tools, enhancing overall efficiency in geological research.

## **🌡️ Thermometers and Barometers Calculations (In Progress) 📊**
We have integrated multiple geological thermometer and barometer calculation models to compute physical parameters such as temperature and pressure. The system provides detailed calculation processes and results explanations, and outputs corresponding phase diagrams and temperature-pressure graphs to assist users in conducting in-depth geological interpretations and analyses, meeting the refined demands of geological research and applications.

## **🤖 AI Assistant 💡**
Responsible for parsing and suggesting specific content in the vectorized base map guidelines, the AI assistant aims to help users propose foundational data requirements and core datasets when faced with ambiguous discriminative analysis scenarios. Through intelligent analysis, the assistant recommends optimal analysis strategies based on the data features provided by users. The ultimate goal is to simplify operational complexity and significantly enhance analysis efficiency and accuracy.

## **📈 Machine Learning Data Analysis 🔍**
Based on machine learning algorithms, we conduct in-depth analysis of users' geochemical data. Users can customize their choice of machine learning models, and the system supports automated hyperparameter tuning, model training, and evaluation. The final outputs include model performance evaluations, variable importance analysis, and related visualizations, such as ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance bar charts, helping users to comprehensively understand analysis results.

## **⚗️ Geochemical Relevant Scientific Calculations 🧪**
We provide a specialized set of scientific calculation tools for geochemical data, covering functionalities such as element correlation analysis, isotope ratio calculations, and rare earth element distribution pattern analysis. This toolkit supports batch processing of data, complex formula calculations, and result visualizations, assisting researchers in efficiently handling and interpreting geochemical data, ensuring the accuracy and repeatability of research outcomes.
