# üå°Ô∏è Geothermometer

The Geothermometer page in the software is abbreviated as **GTM**. It currently includes geothermometer calculations for minerals such as zircon, sphalerite, quartz, arsenopyrite, chlorite, and biotite. It is recommended to download and install the software for specific content, as documentation updates may be delayed.

**The UI of this functional page is planned to undergo significant changes in the future**. We will integrate barometers and thermometer collection functionality on this page.

## üåü Function Description

The overall interface features are divided into sections:

* **Mineral List**: Select the target mineral on the left and choose the specific geothermometer calculation method. The corresponding calculation interface will be displayed on the right.
* **Calculation Area**: The calculation area on the right is divided into two functional pages, consistent with the drawing feature, encompassing both calculation and guide sections.
  * **Calculate**: Responsible for inputting geothermometer data, format validation, calculations, and parameter adjustments.
  * **Guide**: Includes, but is not limited to, information on data import formats, geothermometer summaries, contributor details, and reference literature sources.
