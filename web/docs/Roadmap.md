# 🛣️ Roadmap

# Current

- [x] Continuously update common geological and geochemical diagrams
- [ ] Continuously update common geothermometers and geobarometers
- [ ] Geochronology data plotting

# Planned

- [ ] **Research Community Construction**: We will build a dedicated research community to support researchers in uploading and sharing self-made scientific diagrams. The community will also be equipped with an issue feedback area and forum discussion modules to facilitate member interaction, experience sharing, and solution improvement.
- [ ] **Expand Geochemical Calculation Tools**: Based on user needs, we will continuously update and improve scientific calculation methods related to geochemistry, providing richer calculation functions to support diverse scientific research application scenarios.
- [ ] **Machine Learning Data Analysis**: Future software versions will introduce common machine learning algorithms to assist in geochemical data analysis, providing efficient and intelligent data processing capabilities for researchers.
- [ ] **"New Diagram" Style Machine Learning Model Support**: With the rapid development of big data and machine learning, many models have become new "discriminant diagram" tools. The software will include built-in extensible interfaces to support the rapid loading and training of such models. Researchers can directly apply "new diagrams" for analysis and discrimination without needing to master machine learning or technologies like Python, avoiding complex configuration environments.
- [ ] **AI Intelligent Assistant**: Leveraging built-in help documentation and knowledge-embedded large model technology, the AI assistant will be able to generate targeted solutions based on keywords and needs provided by researchers in the first phase; in the second phase, it will further realize automated data processing and analysis, simplifying scientific research workflows and improving efficiency.
