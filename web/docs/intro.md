# 🌍 Introduction

Let's get started with **GeoChemistry Nexus** in **5 minutes** ⏱️.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, please follow these steps:

1. **Select Download Option** 🌐:
   You can obtain the required content in one of the following ways:
   - **Manual Installation**: Visit the [.NET 6 Official Download Page (Click Here)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) directly and select the appropriate installer for your operating system version.
   - **Follow Prompts**: During software execution, follow the system prompts to automatically jump to the download page to complete the framework installation.
   - **No Manual Configuration Required: Choose the standalone package we provide (no additional runtime framework installation needed)**.
2. **Determine Operating System Type** 💻:
   - For Windows systems, please first determine whether your operating system is `32-bit` or `64-bit`, and select the corresponding version to install.

:::tip

**Windows Users**: Please ensure your operating system version is at least Windows 7.

## Getting Started 🚀

[Click here](https://github.com/MaxwellLei/GeoChemistry-Nexus/releases) to visit the download page. Select the appropriate version, download, and unzip it. Then, double-click to run `GeoChemistry Nexus.exe` 🖱️.

### Package Naming Convention 📦:

**Package naming follows this format: `SoftwareName_Abbreviation_Version_Dependency_OS_Architecture`**

- If the name contains `d`, it indicates that the software depends on the **.NET 6 SDK**, which needs to be installed separately. 🔍
- If `d` is missing, the software already includes necessary components and requires no further installation. ✅

### Note for Linux and Mac Users 🐧🍏:

Currently, there are no detailed instructions for Linux and Mac. It is recommended to prioritize using a virtual machine to run the program. We plan to migrate to `Avalonia` in the future to achieve full cross-platform compatibility. 📅
