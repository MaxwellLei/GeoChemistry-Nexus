# 🌍 Tutorial Introduction

Let's get started with **Geo-Thermometer** in **5 minutes** ⏱️.

## Preparation 🛠️

Before getting started, please ensure you have downloaded and installed the .NET 6 SDK on your operating system. Follow these steps:

1. **Choose the Download Option** 🌐:
   You can obtain the required files through any of the following methods:
   - Visit the [Official .NET 6 Download Page (Click Here)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0), and select the installer suitable for your operating system version.
   - During software operation, follow the system prompts to automatically redirect to the download page and complete the framework installation.
   - Choose the standalone package we provide (no additional runtime installation needed).
2. **Determine Your Operating System Type** 💻:
   - For Windows systems, first confirm whether your OS is `32-bit` or `64-bit`, and choose the corresponding version to install.

## Getting Started 🚀

[Click here](https://github.com/MaxwellLei/GeoChemistry-Nexus/releases) to visit the download page. Select the appropriate version, download it, and extract the files. Then, double-click to run `Geo-Thermometer.exe` 🖱️.

### Package Naming Convention 📦:

**Package names follow the format:** `SoftwareName_Abbreviation_Version_Dependencies_OS_Architecture`

- If the name contains `d`, it indicates that this software depends on **.NET 6 SDK** and requires a separate install. 🔍
- If `d` is missing, the software includes all necessary components and requires no additional installation. ✅

### Notes for Linux and Mac Users 🐧🍏:

Currently, there are no detailed instructions for Linux and Mac. It is recommended to run the program via a virtual machine. Future updates will consider migrating to `Avalonia` for fully cross-platform support. 📅
