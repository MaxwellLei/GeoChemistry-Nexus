# Goal

The initial design goal of the Home page is to integrate quick access to commonly used websites in the field of Earth Science and provide practical widgets to support related operations and calculations, ultimately boosting research efficiency.

The home page primarily displays **Quick Links** and **Widgets**. You can right-click to open the menu bar and view related operations.

Regarding quick links, our design philosophy is that users can add commonly used professional websites in geology and geochemistry. Additionally, the software includes built-in recommended sites. If you would like your website to be added to the home page recommendations, please contact us via the "About" page.

Currently, the home page displays the system date and time by default. It also features a search bar that can search and match user-added quick links and widgets for quick lookup and navigation.

The design goal of widgets is to provide simple, independent, and basic calculation or operational functions to supplement commonly used peripheral tools, facilitating daily use for users.

As the software continues to be updated, the Home page functionality will become even more practical.

We welcome your valuable feedback to help us improve the software's usability and convenience. 🌹
