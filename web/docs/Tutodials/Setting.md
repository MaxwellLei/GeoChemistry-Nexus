# ⚙️ Settings

The settings section of the software is quite diverse and will be continuously updated with more personalization options as features expand.

## General Program Settings

Settings are mainly divided into four parts: File Paths, Internationalization & Personalization, Message Notifications, and Others. Below is a brief description of the main settings:

### 🗨️ Message Notifications

- **Auto-close Duration**: The duration for which message notification pop-ups automatically close during software operation. Please note that error and warning messages need to be closed manually.

### ⚙️ Others

- **Start with System**: The software will start automatically when the system boots.
- **Developer Mode**: This mode provides debugging features for developers. Non-developers are advised not to enable it to avoid unintended operations.
- **Auto Check for Updates**: The software will automatically check for updates upon startup; however, due to server issues, this function is temporarily disabled and will be restored in a future version.
- **Exit Method**: The software can be exited in two ways: Direct Exit or Minimize to System Tray. If you choose to minimize to the tray, you can right-click the tray icon and select Exit to close the software.
